    <h2>Alexander Thomas</h2>
    <p>My name is Alexander Thomas. I am a third year student at the University of the West Indies. I like computers and cars and practice mechanic work in my spare time to calm my nerves and quell the depression I have been dealing with for years now. I am interested in this course because I am interested in front end developer work. Thank you for reading.</p>
